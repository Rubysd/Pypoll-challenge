## Deliverable 3: Analysis of the Election Audit

### 1) Overview of Election Audit:

Explain the purpose of this election audit analysis:

A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following task to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

* Calculate the total number of votes cast.
* Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
* Calculatae the total number of votes each candidate received.
* Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
* Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

After giving you an overview of the election audit tasks, we wants to go over the steps required in detail. Showing you a technique commonly used by programmers to write steps of their code, which is called pseudocode. Pseudocode will make the audit easier to present to nontechnical colleagues and stakeholders.

In this project, our final Python script will need to be able to deliver the following information when the script is run:

* Total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* Total number of votes each candidate received
* Percentage of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote

### 2) Election-Audit Results:
Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.

* How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
* Total Votes Cast in this congressional election was 369,711
* Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.

*County Votes:

#### Jefferson county has 10.5% total percentage with a total votes of 38,855
#### Denver county has the 82.8% total percentage with a total votes of 306,055
#### Arapahoe county has 6.7% total percentage with a total votes of 24,801
#### Which county had the largest number of votes?

#### Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.

*Candidate Percentage of Votes:

#### Charles Casper Stockham candidate has 23.0% total percentage with a total votes of 85,213
#### Diana DeGette candidate has the 73.8 total percentage with a total votes of 272,892
#### Raymon Anthony Doane candidate has 3.1% total percentage with a total votes of 11,606
### Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

*Election Results:

#### Diana DeGette won the election, with a total votes of 272,892
#### In addition, Diana DeGette has the total percentage votes of 73.8%
#### Diana DeGette is the Winner!
